# PowerBI_Project
Created a data visualization report on a dataset from the website

### About Dataset: Used a dataset from the website "https://data.gov/". This website has loads and tonnes of data on many different categories or say different domains. The dataset I'm using to create a small PowerBI project is fdic failed bank list which has a list of data from North America on falied banks for the last 20years.

### Description: 

•	Used web as datasource to extract the data

•	Cleaned the data and applied some transformation on the data

•	Created another table in PBI named 'Calendar' to have a track on the fiscal year which will help my reports 

•	Integrated both the tables (one extracted from the web and Calender table created) to have a relationship so that we could use some of the Data Analysis Expression(DAX) for our reports

•	Simple stacked column charts, bar charts and Q&A has been used in the Report page

•	In another page I have created a simple tooltip using card chart to customize the default tooltip

•	Have used map chart in the tooltip so that when we hover over the visuals we get the region/geographical place displayed along with number of failed banks in that particular state
